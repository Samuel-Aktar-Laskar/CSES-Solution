- You can learn from other people's solutions and improve your programming skills.
- You can help others who are struggling with the problems on CSES by providing them with high-quality solutions and explanations.

In addition to these benefits, contributing to this repository is also a great way to give back to the programming community. By contributing your solutions, you can help others who are just starting out with competitive programming and inspire them to become better programmers.

## How to contribute

Contributing to this repository is easy! Here are the steps to follow:

1. Fork this repository.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine.
3. Choose a section that you want to contribute to (e.g., Sorting and Searching) and create a folder for it.
4. Write your solution to the problem in the folder you created. The file name should be in the format `problem_number_problem_name.cpp` (e.g., `16_longest_flight_route.cpp`).
5. Add a brief explanation of your solution in the file or in a separate README.md file.
